# Data Science & Business Analytics Tasks

**1. Iris Flower Classification ML:**

In this task, I have classified the Iris Flower Class ['Iris-Satosa','Iris-Versicolor','Iris-Virginica'] 150 records in dataset by using multiple models such as:
K-Means
DecisionTreeClassifier Model
Logistic Regression

**2. Prediction using Decision Tree  Algorithm:**

In this task, I have classified the Iris dataset with the help of Decision Tree Classifier algorithm and visulize it. Also, I used Decision Tree Classifier algorithm to identify the class of a Iris plant based on its features.



**3.Prediction using Supervised ML :**

In this task, I have Predicted percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables. I used Linear Regression to identify the scores of student based on hours of study.

# Computer Vision & Internet of Things Tasks


**4. Optical Character Recognition (ORC):**

In this task, I have Created Character detector which extracts printed or handwritten text from an image or video. I used easyocr and cv2 libraries here.
