# Data Science & Business Analytics Tasks

**1. Iris Flower Classification ML:**

In this task, I have classified the Iris Flower Class ['Iris-Satosa','Iris-Versicolor','Iris-Virginica'] 150 records in dataset by using multiple models such as:
K-Means
DecisionTreeClassifier Model
Logistic Regression

**2. Prediction using Decision Tree  Algorithm:**

In this task, I have classified the Iris dataset with the help of Decision Tree Classifier algorithm and visulize it. Also, I used Decision Tree Classifier algorithm to identify the class of a Iris plant based on its features.
